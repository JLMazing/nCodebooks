There are a number of directories useful.

1) The SVM directory contains the code of the Deep Support Vector Regression

To use it on another dataset, please follow the following steps:

1) Change NR_FEATURES in param_letters.h
2) Change the data file in SVM.cpp in the two calls of read_data
   (there are 2 calls, since the first one is used to compute the amount
    of datapoints).
3) Then use make clean 
4) Then use make
5) Run with ./SVM Score_1

The Score_1 file contains parameters found by PSO for the specific dataset,
for another dataset, new parameters have to be found. 

For automatically finding new parameters, do the following:

1) In SIMUL.c put on the return statement in show_simulations
2) Go to the testers directory
3) Use ./start.sh which uses 8 CPU cores, the amount of cores can be
changed at the bottom of bandit.py
4) In bandit.py also the domains of all parameters can be changed, the
most important one would probably be FSIGMA, in case your dataset has
many features (inputs), then FSIGMA should have a higher max value than
now.

The found parameter files will be stored in DSVM_REGRESSION/Results. 
As an example you can see the run of found parameters in the Results dataset.

After running for enough time, the process stops and you can use the
best parameters (with lowest MSE score).
For this do the following:
1) Copy this Score file to the SVM directory
2) Set return of in SIMUL.c
3) Run program with ./SVM.cpp Score_file
