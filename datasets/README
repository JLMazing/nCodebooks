Place datasets in this folder. That way the directories given to the program can be constant.

Datasets needed:
CIFAR10 (binary):	http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Parhaps in future:
CMU_KO8			http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehsiao/datasets.html


Do NOT add datasets to the repository!

You can add it to the folder, but do not use git add on the content. Git is for code.
