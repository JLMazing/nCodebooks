Place datasets in this folder. That way the directories given to the program can be constant.

Datasets needed:
CIFAR10 (binary):	http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Extract the downloaded .tar file into this folder, such that the files are:

CSVM/datasets/cifar-10-batch-bin/<file>.<ext>

Do NOT add datasets to the repository!

You can add it to the folder, but do not use git add on the content. Git is for code.
