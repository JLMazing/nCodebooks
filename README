##CSVM


This program is an experimental platform exploring new variations on the techniques based on the paper 
"Recognizing Handwritten Characters with Local Descriptor and Bags of Visual Words" by Surinta e.a.

This is still early work in progress..



Usage: (linux using g++, CMake and Make)

1. Download the repository, if not already done so.
2. Go to the repository in terminal and type the following:
      cmake .                       (Generates MAKEFILE)
      make                          (builds the project)
      cd build/                     (change directory to the build folder)
      ./CSVM                        (Execute the program)

Usage: (Windows using Visual Studio)
1. Download the repository, if not already done so.
2. Open CSVM.sln
3. To execute: Go to the build folder in terminal, and execute from there

(note: If you execute the program from visual studio, the link to images is relative to 
the main (CSVM) folder. This causes to program to crash in a controlled way, since it cannot find the 
.png files. Because of this you have to execute the program by hand from the "build" folder. Either by a double-click 
or in terminal. Using the terminal is adviced, since the program will disappear directly when finished otherwise.)
