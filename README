This program is an experimental platform exploring new variations on the techniques based on the paper 
"Recognizing Handwritten Characters with Local Descriptor and Bags of Visual Words" by Surinta e.a.


Also see te dataset README in the ./datasets/ folder for download instructions for the required 
datasets.


####################### -GNU/Linux Usage- ############################# 

Usage: (linux using g++, CMake, Make, SWIG, python)

1. Download the repository, if not already done so.
2. Download the dataset as described in the README in the "datasets/" folder.
3. Go to the repository in terminal and type the following:
      cmake .                       (Generates MAKEFILE)
      make                          (builds the project)
      cd build/                     (change directory to the build folder)
      ./CSVM [settingsfile]         (Execute the program)
      or ./run.sh

PSO (Quick Guide)
1. Go to /swig/ and execute ./swig.sh for python wrapper generation. This automatically puts the required wrapper in the /PSO/testers/ directory. 
2. Go to /PSO/testers, and execute ./start.sh. See /PSO/testers/bandit.py for the settings of the PSO run.


#### Settings file ####

For editting PSO-settings, the file /PSO/testers/bandit.py must be editted.

Example:

#### Parameter optimalisation: ####

## Program description ##
In the PSO folder a parameter optimalisation program can be found.

This program tries to find optimal parameters for a "tester"-program, which are found in the 
./PSO/testers/ folder. The tester-file designed for the CSVM program is called bandit.py.
This tester requires the CSVM program in a Python library form. For this SWIG is used, which is 
described in the next section.

## Program usage description ##

# Codebook Generation #   (Is not used at the moment)
The CSVM wrapper uses a pre-generated codebook for the program. This way a lot of
codebook regeneration time can be spared during optimisation. Codebook-construction settings are described 
in ./build/settings.

Set the required settings (ImageScanner, FeatureExtractor, Dataset, Codebook) to the experiment-settings.


Next, the codebook should be generated. This can be done by executing /PSO/testers/generateCodebook.sh.
This script uses the settingsfile from "/build/settings"

If all went well, the file codebook.bin will be added to ./PSO/testers.

# Execution #
The program can be executed by calling the start.sh script in ./PSO/testers/.


#### SWIG-wrapping: ####
For SWIG-wrapping you should first install SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) if not already installed.

The CSVM program is wrapped for Python using SWIG. To adapt the python interface of CSVM,
go to the "swig" folder. The experiment.[cc/h] files describe functions that will be wrapped to python.
The wrapping and compilation process is described, and executable in the swig.sh script.
This script automatically copies the produced python library to the "./PSO/testers/" location,
where the library is needed for parameter optimalisation.


########################## -Windows Usage- ############################

Usage: (Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio)

1. Download the repository, if not already done so.
2. Open CSVM.sln
3. To execute: Go to the build folder in terminal, and execute from there

(note: If you execute the program from visual studio, the link to images is relative to 
the main (CSVM) folder. This causes to program to crash in a controlled way, since it cannot find the 
.png files. Because of this you have to execute the program by hand from the "build" folder. Either by a double-click 
or in terminal. Using the terminal is adviced, since the program will disappear directly when finished otherwise.)

Further usage regarding SWIG and Parameter-Optimalisation on Windows systems have not yet been tried out.
