cellSize 8 #cellSize is best an even-numbered, divisor of patch size. By default it'll be half of patch size
cellStride #cellStride is best an even-numbered, divisor of cellSize. By default it's the same value as cellSize, meaning the patch is divided into quadrants, and not iterated over 
blockSize #the size of a patch
